### Next.js Folder Structure

- /app is where most of the code exists

### Next.js page vs layout

- A page is a React component that is exported from a file in the `app`
  directory. It is used to define a route in your application.

- A layout is a React component that wraps around your pages. It is used to
  define the structure and design of your application. Layouts can be nested,
  allowing you to create complex UI structures.

- Layouts are used to share components across multiple pages, such as headers,
  footers, and sidebars. They can also be used to manage state and data fetching
  for the pages they wrap.
